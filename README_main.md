IWOT
This repository contains the files for my website blog called In Wait of Tomorrow. The project uses the Flask microframework, meaning Python is the server side language.
The app uses a SQLite database to store all of the blog posts.
The app is hosted on Google App Engine, and therefore contains relevant files including an app.yaml.
